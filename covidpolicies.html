                        Young Americans Basketball Club takes the COVID-19 pandemic very seriously
                        and we are committed to protecting the health and safety of our players and 
                        staff by ensuring that we adhere to guidelines set by the CDC and Arizona 
                        Department of Health Services. In addition to mandatory temperature checks, 
                        hand washing/sanitization at every one of our indoor events including
                        practices, and the wearing of masks when not actively playing on the court, 
                        we strongly ask any player or staff member who has any COVID-19 related
                        symptoms to stay home and consult with a medical professional before returning
                        to the club. Additionally, at this time, <b><i>we are enforcing a policy of only 
                        players and coaches allowed at all indoor events including practices.</i></b> 
                        This unfortunately means that family and friends will not be allowed inside any
                        of our gyms or as an in-person spectator. We know how difficult that will be
                        for all of our incredibly supportive families, but we know that you will understand
                        and support our decisions as it is solely in the interest of protecting our
                        players and staff. We greatly look forward to a day when this is all behind us
                        and we can again welcome you all into our gyms so you can enjoy all of the hard
                        work your players have put into their games. Thank you and please don't hesitate
                        to let us know if you have any questions or concerns.
